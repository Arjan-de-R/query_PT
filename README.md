Query public transport connections for set of trip requests (from origin to a destination at given departure time). 

> This python library uses OpenTripPlanner to query single or multiple trips (origin, destination, departure time) for their detailed PT routes. 
>
> It was succesfully applied to query 3 million trips from 6 different cities in one of our research projects.
